Short paper that gives us some base factors to consider relating to mortality.
These factors could be used to train a model for prognosis prediction of future victims

The authors create a simple model that assumes a 100% connected population, giving a rather pessimistic estimate for infection.
The core Susceptible, Infected, Recovered (SIR) model they use is well defined and can be re-applied to other data for our analysis.
They add other factors and show how they incorporate them, so if we find other things we need to take into account, we can base it off this.
